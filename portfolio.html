      <br>
    <p style="color:#3457D5"> My first project is called, King of the Hammer. In this game, the player puts in a certain power level so that the levels of the machine reach to the very tippy top and they win. </p>
    <p style="color:#3457D5"> If the player puts in the wrong power level in the input, the output would not have the levels go all the way up and the machine would tell them to try again. </p>

    <p style="color:#3457D5"> My second project is called, The Butterfly Catcher. In this game, the player's goal is to catch as many butterflies within a time limit. </p>
    <p style="color:#3457D5"> There are three levels with 20 second countdowns and the player clicks the randomized butterflies in order to succeed in getting many points. </p>

      <br>
    <p style="color:#3457D5"> My third project is called, National Alien Abduction Day E-Card. In this interactive card, the user is clicking around the area as objects and even people start being abducted by a UFO. </p>
    <p style="color:#3457D5"> There are two scenes with a card that pops up at the end to make the e-card more aesthetic. We have many functions like walkcycles, def, and much more that make the card complicated but exciting! </p>

	    <br>
    <p style="color:#3457D5"> My fourth project is called, A pHishy Fish Tank. In this project, there were errors of this specific company's website that users had to find to fix the security breaches. </p>	
    <p style="color:#3457D5"> These errors were mostly value errors like the placing or the number value that breaks the code. </p>
